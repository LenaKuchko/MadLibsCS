    <h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
    <p>One day, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() were walking through the woods,
    when suddenly a giant @Model.GetAnimal() appeared. "@Model.GetExclamation()!"
    @Model.GetPerson1() cried. The two of them @Model.GetVerb() as quickly as possible,
    and when they were safe, @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() gave each other a giant @Model.GetNoun(). @Model.GetPerson1() and @Model.GetPerson2() were eating the giant @Model.GetNoun() when a @Model.GetColor() @Model.GetAnimal2() appeared out of nowhere! "@Model.GetExclamation()!" yelled  @Model.GetPerson2().</p>
